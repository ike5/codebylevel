# Depth of Detail in CodeByLevel

Each documentation entry in CodeByLevel includes a `Y` value that represents the **depth of detail** provided in that particular explanation. This allows content to be written at varying levels of technical specificity, giving readers control over how deep they want to go into a topic.

The `Y` value ranges from `0` to `4`, each corresponding to an increasing level of detail and complexity.
