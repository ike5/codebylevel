# Style of Explanation in CodeByLevel

Each documentation entry in CodeByLevel includes a `Z` value representing the **style of explanation** — the way the content is presented pedagogically or cognitively to best suit different types of learners. This allows contributors to write content tailored not just to experience level or depth, but to **how** a person learns.

The `Z` value ranges from `0` to `8`, each corresponding to a distinct instructional or cognitive strategy.

## 0: Narrative

**Focus:** Storytelling, analogy, and context-driven explanation.  
**Best for:** Beginners, readers new to the topic.  
**Includes:**
- Descriptive language
- Real-world comparisons
- “Imagine this…” or “Think of it like…” statements

---

## 1: Structural

**Focus:** Relationships, hierarchies, and architecture.  
**Best for:** Visual learners, those familiar with object models or diagrams.  
**Includes:**
- Diagrams, class trees, system maps
- Relationship-based reasoning
- Entity-component breakdowns

---

## 2: Procedural

**Focus:** Step-by-step processes and workflows.  
**Best for:** Learners who benefit from clear instructions and linear progression.  
**Includes:**
- Numbered steps
- Setup instructions
- “First do this, then that” sequences

---

## 3: Associative

**Focus:** Comparisons to previously learned or better-known concepts.  
**Best for:** Developers transitioning between languages or technologies.  
**Includes:**
- “This is like X in Y”
- Cross-language references
- Transfer learning approaches

---

## 4: Logical

**Focus:** Rule-based reasoning, causality, and decision flow.  
**Best for:** Abstract thinkers, debuggers, and problem-solvers.  
**Includes:**
- If-then structures
- Explanations of behavior and control flow
- Conditional examples and proofs

---

## 5: Pedagogical

**Focus:** Teaching through questions, contrast, and reflection.  
**Best for:** Mentors, educators, and curious learners.  
**Includes:**
- Socratic prompts
- “What if…” and misconception correction
- Compare/contrast styles

---

## 6: Exploratory

**Focus:** Experimentation, open-ended learning, and discovery.  
**Best for:** Self-guided learners and tinkerers.  
**Includes:**
- Interactive environments
- Editable code blocks
- “Try it yourself” scenarios

---

## 7: Critical

**Focus:** Performance, trade-offs, edge cases, and failure modes.  
**Best for:** Experts, architects, and those making technical decisions.  
**Includes:**
- Benchmarks and metrics
- Risks, caveats, and trade-offs
- Performance tuning, scaling concerns

---

## 8: Historical

**Focus:** Evolution of the concept or practice over time.  
**Best for:** Specialists, educators, and language contributors.  
**Includes:**
- Deprecated patterns
- Version history
- Why the system is the way it is

These styles can be combined, but the dominant `Z` value should reflect the primary instructional method used. Readers can filter documentation based on the style that suits them best.
