## Contribution Guidelines

### Skill-Level Tags

When adding or editing documentation, please indicate the intended developer skill level using the following tags in
your doc metadata:

- **A** — Newbie
- **B** — Intermediate
- **C** — Professional
- **D** — Expert
- **E** — Specialist

Use these tags to help users find the right level of detail for their needs.

### Documentation Format

- Use the [CodeByLevel file format](link-to-format-spec) for consistent structure.
- Include version information for the language/tool your docs apply to.
- Provide examples in multiple styles if possible (code-only, explanation, combined).
- Maintain clear, concise, and inclusive language.

### Branching and Versioning

- Create branches named after the language/tool version you're documenting, e.g., `python-3.10`.
- Base your changes on the latest stable version branch.
- Avoid deleting previous versions — documentation evolves alongside the software.
