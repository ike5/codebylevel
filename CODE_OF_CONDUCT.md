# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of CodeByLevel, pledge to foster a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone — regardless of experience level, gender identity, age, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, or personal background.

We are committed to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for all, where people of every skill level can learn, teach, and grow.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment:

- Offering respectful, constructive feedback  
- Being patient with new contributors and learners  
- Acknowledging different levels of expertise  
- Giving credit and attribution when appropriate  
- Welcoming diverse perspectives and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Insults, personal attacks, or discriminatory jokes  
- Dismissing beginner questions or gatekeeping  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information without consent  
- Disruptive trolling or intentionally derailing discussions

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate, fair action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — GitHub, issues, pull requests, discussions, chat, and future in-person or online events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at [your-email@example.com].

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
